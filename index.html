                I began my education at İstanbul Yedikule Anatolian High School between 2017-2021, where I
                laid the
                foundation for my academic career.
                After high school, I pursued an associate degree in Computer Programming at İstanbul Bilgi
                University between
                2021-2023.
                Currently, I am continuing my studies at Karabük University (starting 2023), where I am working
                toward a degree
                in Computer Engineering.
            </p>
            <p class="description">
                I first started programming with game development on the Unity Engine using C# in 2015. During
                these times
                I started learning 3D modeling with Blender and drawing for game development with Photoshop.
                After a couple of years I continued game development with modding Minecraft using Java.
                Currently, I am using C++ to make my own game engine and develop games from scratch.
            </p>
            <p class="description">
                During my programming journey I also worked on:
            <ul>
                <li>Web development with HTML, CSS, Javascript (Minimal), PHP.</li>
                <li>Databases with SQL.</li>
                <li>Scripting with Python.</li>
                <li>Android app development with Java.</li>
            </ul>
            </p>
            <p class="description">
                In high school I also worked on a short film with my friends using Adobe Premiere and Adobe
                After Effects.

                        A functional-WIP lightweight rendering engine for C++ using OpenGL, GLAD, GLM and GLFW
                        libraries and is built using CMake.
                        It contains a custom Wavefront 3D model importer for .obj and .mtl files and can calculate
                        the face tangents for normal mapping.
                        It allows custom vertex attribute definitions for flexibility.
                        I am currently working on shadow casting.

                        A small and lightweight resource manager for C++ built using CMake that keeps track of loaded
                        resources and unloads them when appropriate.
                        It allows three storage categories: Manual, Persistent and Volatile.
                    <ul>
                        <li>Manual category does not unload the resource until explicitly told to.</li>
                        <li>Persistent category unloads the resource some time after the use count reaches zero.
                        </li>
                        <li>Volatile category unloads the resource when use count reaches zero.</li>

                    <p class="description">
                        It uses a token object for resource access that increments/decrements the use count for
                        resources on construction/destruction.

                        A WIP game engine written in C++ built using CMake.
                        9th iteration of my custom game engine built for making 3D games with lower graphics
                        quality.
                        My goal is to make a game using minimal libraries and this engine is closer to being
                        complete than my previous iterations.
                        It uses a scene graph system and saves scene nodes using JSON. It currently has built-in
                        nodes for skybox and billboard rendering, light casting and camera.
                        It uses an early version of built-in Ibex Renderer and on hold until the first definitive
                        renderer version. Current version has problems with shadow rendering but otherwise working for
                        general model viewing with Phong lighting model using specular, normal and displacement maps.
                    </p>
